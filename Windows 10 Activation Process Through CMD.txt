Activate Windows 10 Using CMD12
Activating Windows 10 using Command Prompt (CMD) is a straightforward process. It involves accessing the Command Prompt with administrative privileges and running a few specific commands.


1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator: Right-click on the Start menu and select “Command Prompt (Admin)” or “Windows PowerShell (Admin).”
2. Install the Windows 10 Product Key: slmgr /ipk W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX
3. Set the KMS Server: slmgr /skms zh.us.to OR slmgr /skms kms.xspace.in
4. Activate Windows: slmgr /ato



After running these commands, your Windows 10 should be activated. You can verify the activation status by typing slmgr /xpr in the Command Prompt and pressing Enter.
Important Considerations
* Ensure Administrative Privileges: Always run CMD as an administrator to avoid permission issues.
* Double-Check Your Product Key: Make sure your 25-character product key is correct to prevent errors during activation.
* Stable Internet Connection: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, especially if you’re using KMS activation.
* Verify KMS Server Address: Double-check the KMS server address to avoid connection problems.
* Check Activation Status Regularly: Use slmgr /xpr to periodically verify the activation status of your Windows 10.
By following these steps, you can easily activate your Windows 10 using CMD and ensure that your operating system is fully functional and up-to-date.
